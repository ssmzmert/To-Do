The sign-up page allows users to create a new account. Users need to provide a valid email address and a password to create an account.

To-Do List Page
The to-do list page displays all the to-do items associated with the logged-in user. To add a new to-do item, click on the "ADD" button, and fill in the title and description fields. To edit a to-do item, click on the item, and update the fields. To delete a to-do item, click on the checkbox next to the item then click "REMOVE".

The search bar allows users to search for to-do items by title or description. Type the search query in the search bar, and the list will update in real-time to show only the matching items.
